This is a starter project for developing a JavaScript web application using:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

Though the goal of this starter project is easy prototyping, it also provides a
solid foundation for a modern web application.

## Features

- Tailwind CSS integration
- Optimized stylesheets ([PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com/))
- Routing
- Code splitting
- Static export

Not included: testing, linting.

## Getting Started

First, create a new project and install the dependencies:

```bash
npx degit code2k/react-tailwind-prototyper newproject
cd newproject
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/index.js`. The page
auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Build

Generate an optimized production build:

```bash
yarn build
```
